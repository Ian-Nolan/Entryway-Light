# Entryway-Light
This is a small system utilizing an ESP32-S3 that enables a light when one of my roommates or myself is nearby the front doorway. Glad you're checking it out!

As of October 1, 2025, the sketch running on the ESP32-S3 at my doorway is only driving an LED on the breadboard. I am currently waiting for a CloudFree Smart Bulb that has Tasmota pre-installed to become available (https://cloudfree.shop/product/cloudfree-smart-bulb-rgbcw/). They are frequently out of stock because flashing with Tasmota has to be done manually. Once that arrives, it will replace my front door's lamp and I will use the Tasmota REST API to command the bulb to enable, disable, and change white balance.
